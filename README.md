## 🚀 Usage & Workflows

This section provides a high-level overview of how to use each project. For comprehensive guides and detailed examples, please refer to the project-specific documentation.

### 🧠 AI Study Workflow

The `AI Study Workflow` is primarily driven through the `n8n` web interface or by triggering its exposed webhooks/APIs.

<details>
<summary>💡 Common AI Study Workflow Use Cases</summary>

1.  **Running a Quiz Generator Workflow:**
    *   Access the `n8n` dashboard (`http://localhost:5678`).
    *   Import the `quiz-generator.json` workflow from `projects/ai-study-workflow/workflows/`.
    *   Configure the workflow with your study material (e.g., a text input, URL, or document upload).
    *   Execute the workflow manually or set up a schedule/webhook trigger.
    *   The workflow will use an LLM to generate questions and answers, which can then be saved or presented.

2.  **Automating Note Summarization:**
    *   Import the `note-taking.json` workflow.
    *   Set up a trigger, e.g., watching a specific folder for new `.txt` or `.md` files.
    *   The workflow processes the new file, sends its content to an LLM for summarization, and saves the summary to another location or a Notion page.

> [!NOTE]
> Detailed examples and setup guides for each workflow (`note-taking.json`, `quiz-generator.json`, etc.) are available in the [AI Study Workflow - WORKFLOWS.md](projects/ai-study-workflow/docs/WORKFLOWS.md).
</details>

### 📄 Gemma OCR

The `Gemma OCR` project can be used for both training new OCR models and performing predictions on existing images.

<details>
<summary>📝 Common Gemma OCR Use Cases</summary>

1.  **Performing OCR on an Image:**
    ```bash
    # Ensure you are in the projects/gemma_ocr directory
    cd projects/gemma_ocr

    # If you have a trained model, specify its path. Otherwise, use a default/pre-trained one.
    python -m gemma_ocr.modeling.predict --image-path ../../references/sample_document.png --output-format text
    # This command will output the extracted text directly to the console.

    # You can also save the output to a file
    python -m gemma_ocr.modeling.predict --image-path ../../references/sample_invoice.jpg --output-file extracted_text.txt
    ```

2.  **Training a Custom OCR Model:**
    *   **Prepare your Dataset:** Organize your images and their corresponding ground truth text into the format expected by `gemma_ocr.dataset.py`.
    *   **Configure Training:** Modify a YAML configuration file (e.g., `config/custom_train.yaml`) to specify dataset paths, model parameters, and training hyperparameters.
    *   **Run Training:**
        ```bash
        cd projects/gemma_ocr
        python -m gemma_ocr.modeling.train --config config/custom_train.yaml
        ```
        The trained model checkpoints will be saved in the `models/` directory.
